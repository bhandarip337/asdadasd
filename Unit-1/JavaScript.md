# Introduction to Operating System

</div>

## History
---------------------

This might be surprising for many of you, but earlier the operating systems were not there. With the development of technology, operating systems have also been introduced. Earlier in the 1940s, the computer systems used to work on the programs. The users used to input these programs in the machine hardware by using the micro switches. Later on, in the year 1950, some new technologies were developed. These technologies were introduced in order to make the interaction between the user and the computer system easier.

It was in the year ``1956`` when the first operating system was introduced. It was introduced in order to make the IBM mainframe computer run. It was introduced by General Motors. Later on, other owners of IBM Mainframe Computer followed a similar pattern for making the operating system for their computer system. If we look at the computer systems from different generations, then they have been classified into 4 generations according to their architecture. But you should also know that the architecture of these computers is also related to the operating systems.

Like the 1st Generation Computers which were introduced in the year 1940, they did not have any operating systems. No one even thought of an operating system or would have heard about it. The digital computers at that time worked with the help of the programs only like we have mentioned above. Even there were no programming languages also at that time.

Then in the 2nd Generation, in the 1950s some improvement was brought and it was the time when the first operating systems were introduced, about which we have mentioned above. It was introduced for IBM 701. At that time there was the single-stream batch processing system. It was because the users used to submit data and programs in the batches or the groups.

In the 3rd Generation, in the 1960s, some advanced technologies were developed. The multiprogramming concept was introduced by the operating system designers in the 1960s. There were many new techniques which were introduced in the operating system. Due to the multiprogramming concept, several jobs were done at the same time. When a job was waiting for the Input-Output Operation, at the same time the CPU was used by another job, unlike the old operating system without the multiprogramming feature. The operating systems in the 3rd generation were made in such a way that all the programs can run at a fast speed and can get completed fast. It also made the other programs initiate and start soon which are waiting to run. The time-sharing feature was also introduced in the 3rd generation operating system. To multi-program the interactive users in large numbers, the time-sharing technique was made.

In the 4th Generation, the operating systems were used in personal computers also. This was made possible by the Large-Scale Integration Circuits Development. Some of the operating systems which were used at that time are, UNIX and MS-DOS.

At present, there are many operating systems which are in use like Linux and Microsoft Windows. For mobile phones also, we have operating systems like Android and IOS. At present, most of us are using the Windows Operating System, which was introduced in the year 1985.

## Introduction and Generation of Operating System

### **Introduction to Operating System**

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is a large collection of system software, which manages the resources of computer system such as ``memory``, ``storage``, ``processor``, ``I/O devices`` and it also acts as an interface between machine and user. Moreover, it also performs the basic tasks such as reorganization of peripherial devices, sending-recieving information to the external sources keeping task of files, folders on the disk and other different utility task.

The organization or architecture of OS deals with the internal structure of OS, mainly is divided into 3 layers as shown in figure below:

- **``Kernel``**: A main part of OS always remains in the main memory during the running of computer called ``kernel``. It is the main controlling part of OS which controls all running programs and hardware resources.

- **``Utility Software``**: Outside this layer, there is a set of utility programs which are used as a system management tool, also known as house keepingwork of OS.Utility programs help manage, maintain and control computer resources. These programs are available to help you with the day-to-day chores associated with personal computing and to keep your system running at peak performance.

- **``Application Software``**: Application software is developed in order to fulfill user requirements. Different Application software is available in the market as readymade software. Some of them are developed on the user's demand called tailored software.


### **Generation of Operating System**

``Operating Systems`` have evolved over the years. So, their evolution through the years can be mapped using generations of operating systems. There are four generations of operating systems. These can be described as follows :

-   **The First Generation ( 1945 - 1955 ) ``Vacuum Tubes and Plugboards``**
-   **The Second Generation ( 1955 - 1965 ) ``Transistors and Batch SystemsTransistors``**
-   **The Third Generation ( 1965 - 1980 ) ``Integrated Circuits and Multiprogramming``**
-   **The Fourth Generation ( 1980 - Present ) ``Personal Computers``**

**Explanation:**

#### **The First Generation ( 1945 - 1955 ) ``Vacuum Tubes and Plugboards``**

Digital computers were not constructed until the second world war.Calculating engines with mechanical relays were built at that time. However, the mechanical relays were very slow and were later replaced with vacuum tubes. These machines were enormous but were still very slow.

These early computers were designed, built and maintained by a single group of people. Programming languages were unknown and there were no operating systems so all the programming was done in machine language. All the problems were simple numerical calculations.

By the 1950’s punch cards were introduced and this improved the computer system. Instead of using plugboards, programs were written on cards and read into the system.

#### **The Second Generation ( 1955 - 1965 ) ``Transistors and Batch Systems``**

Transistors led to the development of the computer systems that could be manufactured and sold to paying customers. These machines were known as mainframes and were locked in air-conditioned computer rooms with staff to operate them.

The Batch System was introduced to reduce the wasted time in the computer. A tray full of jobs was collected in the input room and read into the magnetic tape. After that, the tape was rewound and mounted on a tape drive. Then the batch operating system was loaded in which read the first job from the tape and ran it. The output was written on the second tape. After the whole batch was done, the input and output tapes were removed and the output tape was printed.

#### **The Third Generation ( 1965 - 1980 ) ``Integrated Circuits and Multiprogramming``**

 Until the 1960’s, there were two types of computer systems i.e the scientific and the commercial computers. These were combined by IBM in the System/360. This used integrated circuits and provided a major price and performance advantage over the second generation systems.

The third generation operating systems also introduced multiprogramming. This meant that the processor was not idle while a job was completing its I/O operation. Another job was scheduled on the processor so that its time would not be wasted.

#### **The Fourth Generation ( 1980 - Present ) ``Personal Computers``**

Personal Computers were easy to create with the development of large-scale integrated circuits. These were chips containing thousands of transistors on a square centimeter of silicon. Because of these, microcomputers were much cheaper than minicomputers and that made it possible for a single individual to own one of them.

The advent of personal computers also led to the growth of networks. This created network operating systems and distributed operating systems. The users were aware of a network while using a network operating system and could log in to remote machines and copy files from one machine to another.
